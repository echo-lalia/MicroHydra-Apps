short_description: Conway's Game of Life

description: |
  This is a colorful implementaiton of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) on a 60x34 grid (with edge wrapping).  
  Pressing space pauses/plays the simulation, ctrl+space moves it one step, backspace resets the grid, G0 generates a random 'soup', the function keys add some arbitrary pre-defined object, and all other keys simply write the key as text to the grid.

devices:
- Cardputer
- TDeck
