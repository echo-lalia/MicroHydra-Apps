<br/>

This app randomly arranges a bunch of [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) (and obsticals), and simulates them.  
You can also hit enter to get a new random setup.

This app randomly selects one of a few different pre-determined sets of input parameters.  
Then, randomly places boids and (randomly sized) obsticals around the screen.
